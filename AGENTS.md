# Agent instructions

## Releases paused

No public releases until this repo is marked Clear in the maintainer's private release audit. Do not publish, re-publish, or restore any release, IPA, or app build, and do not add download links, until then.

Before any future public release, every artifact must pass `scripts/release/check_public_assets.sh <artifact>...`, which runs `python3 ~/.codex/release-gate/release_gate.py` on the maintainer's machine. A failure is a stop, not a note.

## Personal builds stay personal

The game module (`gGZLE01_recomp.dylib`) is translated from the player's own disc. An IPA or app that contains it is a personal build: never upload, attach, commit or link it anywhere. Public releases hold source plus the app without game code (`scripts/builder/build.sh --app-only --ipa BlueWake-vX.Y.Z-ios-unsigned.ipa`, checked with PadForge's `audit` before upload); players add their own module with PadForge (`padforge make bluewake ios`) or `scripts/builder/build.sh DISC.iso --ipa OUT.ipa`.
