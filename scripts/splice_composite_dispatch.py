"""Apply generate_composite.py's dispatch block to a composite tree, and check it.

Why this exists. The composite generator does not run end to end from this tree
(scripts/generate_composite.py reports "REL module 181 section 1 linked range
[0x804000f4, 0x80400fd0) overlaps retail MEM1" against the REL inputs the tree
holds; see docs/status/CURRENT.md, 2026-09-18), so the header the composite is
built from cannot be regenerated as a whole. The dispatch block can, and it is
the part the P1 workstream changes: it is emitted independently of the chunk
lists, so it can be lifted out of a generator run and written into a tree.

That is what this does, and it is why it exists rather than a paste: the
generator writes the artifact and this writes the check with it. Every region is
matched exactly or the script refuses, and the result is re-read and compared
against the generator's own text, so a tree either holds the generator's block
or the command fails.

Usage:
  scripts/splice_composite_dispatch.py COMPOSITE_DIR [--check]

  COMPOSITE_DIR   directory holding generated_composite.h and generated.h
  --check         verify and report only; write nothing

Private input is not involved: the synthetic fixture is built by
tests/test_composite.py, which is the same fixture the generator's own tests use.
