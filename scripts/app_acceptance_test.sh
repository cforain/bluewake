# BlueWake app acceptance test: the terminal condition, driven by real keys.
#
# Launches the real app bundle the way a double-click does - an empty
# environment where only HOME survives - then presses real OS-delivered keys
# into that process's window through /tmp/bwfocus and /tmp/bwkey. No synthetic
# pad button is armed anywhere here, so every button the guest sees comes from a
# real key press, and a press only counts when the guest's own controller record
# shows it: [input-chain] cpad_trig, read from 0x803A4E22.
#
# A landed press is necessary but not sufficient, and that difference is why this
# test failed a clause while the app was working. The title's confirm and the
# name-entry screens poll the pad, so a press delivered between polls is recorded
# by the guest and ignored by it. The route's own log says so - the A pulse that
# moves the title is the second one, at title-confirm-ready retrace=386, not the
# one at title-ready retrace=334 - and the negative control at /tmp/bw-live/kb1.log
# records a landed press at retrace=459 after which the title never moved. A
# person in that position taps again. So each driver below taps a real key until
# the guest's own milestone reports, and every tap still has to land.
#
# Two further false failures were chased down before this test could be trusted,
# and both are fixed here rather than worked around:
#   * the guest's own pad record does not use the wire button mask, so a real
#     RETURN lands as cpad_trig=0x0010 and not 0x1000 (see the counters below);
#   * name-input-complete used to be reported only while the route's virtual
#     start pulse was armed, so no live run could ever observe it. The runtime
#     now reports the name-scene milestones from guest state whether or not a
#     route pulse exists, and the walk accepts either that milestone or the
#     guest opening the new-game intro, which subsumes it.
#
# What the default (game) pass proves, in order:
#   1. the app opens with no exported variables and reaches the title screen;
#   2. real J presses reach the guest as cpad_trig=0x0100 and its own title poll
#      takes one, reporting boot-milestone file-select;
#   3. real keys walk the new game - A through the file menu until the guest's
#      own name-entry grid is up, then A to type a character, RETURN to move the
#      guest's own selection to the END cell, and A to confirm - each phase
#      waiting for the guest's own screen state rather than a press count, until
#      the guest reports name-input-complete or opens the new-game intro;
#   4. the intro loads, runs out, and play-scene reports, with the wall time from
#      launch to play-scene read out of the host's own frame-timing stamps;
#   5. a real held W at Outset moves the guest's own player position, so the drive
#      is a measured displacement and not a claimed one, and the guest's stick
#      word shows the stick arrived;
#   6. a real RETURN and a real left arrow are delivered at Outset;
#   7. the run stops normally at the retrace ceiling with no crash, the graphics
#      core shut down with zero rejects and zero failures, and the LLE DSP
#      produced nonzero audio.
#
# The screenshot of Outset under control comes from BLUEWAKE_CAPTURE_PLAYER_READY,
# which fires on the retrace Link leaves the opening cutscene's demo state. Every
# PPM stays in /tmp.
#
# The bar this pass is read against needs a decision, and the arithmetic says so:
# Link takes control at retrace 19,972, which at the console's authentic 60 Hz is
# 332.9 s of authored content. A paced application cannot present content in less
# wall time than it takes to play at any emulator speed, so the cold new game
# cannot meet a five-minute launch-to-interactive bar and never could. The PRD
# forbids a save-state warm start but not continuing from a save the game itself
# wrote, and that path is what fits. See docs/status/PLAN_2026-09-18.md (M2).
#
# The --menu pass is the cheap front half of the same thing: a shorter run with a
# picture series, for the double-click-to-file-menu clause alone.
#
# Usage: scripts/app_acceptance_test.sh [--menu] [--retraces N] [--frames DIR]
#                                       [--card-source PATH]
#
# The run is given a *copy* of a card, never the user's own slot. The default
# source is the canonical route card, which is the empty card the documented
# route uses, so the walk takes the new-game path to Outset. The user's own card
# is hashed before and after and has to come back byte-identical.
#
# Requires: build/runtime-host-dsp/BlueWake.app, the route card at
# local-research/evidence/outset-performance-route-v1-20260901/run1.card, and the
# user's own card at ~/Library/Application Support/BlueWake/GZLE01.card.

# The new-file walk is driven by the guest's own screen, not by a press order.
# This is not a stylistic choice, it is the finding that cost two runs: the walk
# used to press New Game, begin-the-file, type-a-character, RETURN, confirm in a
# fixed order and repeat the whole sequence if a round did not take. On
# 2026-09-14 two rounds pressed all five buttons, every press landed in the
# guest's own controller record, and the guest still reported nothing. The
# runtime's [name-scene-state] probe, which reads the same five values the
# route's name driver gates on, says why: the A pressed as "type a character"
# arrived while the guest's active proc was still 5, so it was recorded and
# ignored, the guest reached its name screen with an empty name, and an empty
# name is never accepted. From there the guest sat at sel_menu=4 sel_proc=1|2
# with cur_pos=0 for the rest of both rounds, toggling on every press, while the
# five-press loop kept pressing blind. A press order is only a driver when the
# screen it assumes already exists.
#
# So each phase below waits for the guest to say it is ready, and a phase that
# cannot advance fails and reports the state it saw instead of pressing harder.
# The road map is the route's own gate order, read from its recorded log
# (selected slot 576, new file 624, character 684, name end 691, confirm 696,
# name-input-complete 712) and from the source it drives:
#   * the name-entry screen is active proc 7 - main_proc=7;
#   * the letter grid is showing when sel_proc=0, and A types the character the
#     cursor is on, moving cur_pos off 0;
#   * START (RETURN on the keyboard, wire 0x1000, guest 0x0010) is what the
#     route calls "name end": it moves the guest's own selection to the row that
#     holds the END button, sel_menu=4;
#   * A on the END cell is the confirm, and the guest reports name-input-complete
#     or opens the new-game intro.

# retraces after the title screen, with the picture to match. The probe below
# reads the player pointer directly, so it needs no hook and cannot be skipped.
# Field order: demo_type demo_mode proc event_mode event msg pad_hold x y z
# This used to be one sed -E whose tenth field was written \10, and BSD sed
# reads that as group 1 followed by a literal 0: on any line whose demo_type is

# The play scene opens on the authored Outset `awake` cutscene, and the

# only ever drove with pulses. It is not a stall: `awake.stb` drives a separate
# fpcNm_MESG cutscene-text actor whose source-defined states 5 (`outwait`) and
# 10 (`closewait`) consume A/B, and every authored page suspends JStudio until
# it is confirmed. The route clears each page with an A pulse armed exactly
# while that actor is in one of those two states, and Link takes control back at
# `demo_mode` 4 - the same pair the player-ready capture is scheduled from. Its
# own run of this card confirms nine pages, the first at retrace 17,868, the
# last at 19,773, and control at 19,972.
#
# So this driver presses a real J (A) while the guest's own record is *not* in
# the control tuple, and stops the instant it is: the key is released between
# attempts so the cutscene actor sees a fresh trigger rather than a held button,
# and a press that does not land is still a failure.
#
# v23 priced the old stop condition. That run stopped feeding A the moment
# `control-admitted` fired, and the message sequence re-armed nine retraces
# later at retrace 20,173; the run then sat in `demo_type=2 demo_mode=6` for
# 2,817 retraces with the position pinned, so the 6 s W hold at 20,194 was
# measured against a sequence that does not move the player. Two things in
# v23's own record say which way to fix it. The messages do need A -- `msg`
# walked 16->17->18->19 while A was flowing in the sequence ending at 20,155 and
# then held at 16 for fifty-seven seconds once A stopped -- so the driver cannot
# simply stop. And the A press that caused the admission, at about 20,160, is
# followed by the re-arm at 20,173, so the driver must stop the moment the
# control tuple is read rather than one press later. This driver does both, and
# holds the stick throughout: what a person does at this cutscene is hold the
# stick and tap A only while the game is not taking input.
