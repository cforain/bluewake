# Instructions per live-play retrace, for judging a digest-green change.
#
# scripts/bench.sh reports wall-clock fps, which varies 2-5% between runs of the
# identical artifact - wider than most emitter changes are worth. Instruction
# counts do not vary that way: the guest work is gated by the route digest, so
# two builds with the same digest execute the same guest instructions, and the
# only difference is what the host spent to execute them. On 2026-09-18 this
# measured the live play window at IPC 4.01, which is why instruction count is
# the metric for this workstream rather than speed (docs/status/CURRENT.md).
#
# It works by differencing two headless runs of the same route: the difference
# between N and N+delta retraces is exactly the delta live-play retraces, so
# subtracting their /usr/bin/time -l totals isolates the play window. No rebuild
# needed, about three minutes.
#
# Usage: scripts/bench_instructions.sh [--low N] [--high N]
#
# Environment:
#   BLUEWAKE_INSTR_REFERENCE   instructions per play retrace to compare against
#                              (default 409200000, the tree's pre-tolerance
#                              control, so the printed delta is the landed
#                              zero-charge tolerance's own gain)
#   BLUEWAKE_BENCH_VARIANT     which build's recorded stops to guard against:
#                              landed (default, the tree) or control (the
#                              pre-zero-charge-tolerance artifact). The tolerance
#                              halves the host turn count without changing the
#                              guest work, so the same stopped pc arrives at a
#                              different count and each build needs its own row.
