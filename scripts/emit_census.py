"""Attribute emitted host code to guest opcodes, per generated chunk.

The dynamic census in docs/status/CURRENT.md says the play scene is
instruction-bound at IPC 4.01, so the only lever is fewer host instructions per
guest instruction - and the guest side is a long tail, which means the fix has to
be broad rather than targeted at a few functions. The question that leaves is
*which* guest instructions are expensive to emit, because that is where a leaner
emitter pays.

This reads a generated chunk's Cyrillic-comment markers (``// 8031A6E8: lwz
r3, 0(r4)``) and counts the emitted C the emitter produced for each one,
aggregated by mnemonic. Emitted lines are a size proxy, not time; the dynamic
share of each opcode is a separate measurement. But it does answer, cheaply and
for the whole chunk, where the emitted code actually goes.

Usage: scripts/emit_census.py generated_chunk.c [--top N]
