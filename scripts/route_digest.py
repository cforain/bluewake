# D1, docs/GOAL_PROMPT_V16_2026-09-14.md. The delivery-timing aggregate is not
# a guest-state record. `[cycle-delivery] summary` shares the tag this selector
# matches on, so its `hash=` field -- an aggregate over (cycle, cause, pc,
# context) -- used to gate the route digest, which made any change to
# interrupt-delivery timing fail the gate by construction. V14 already decided
# that schedule must not gate the digest when it moved `[delivery-hash]`
# outside the record set; this finishes that decision. The counts and the DSP
# cadence stay in the record; only the timing hash is canonicalised away, and
# delivery timing is gated as a bounded quantity instead of an equality.

# D2, docs/status/CURRENT.md "2026-09-17 the DSP slice has Dolphin's idle skip
# switched off, and it is worth 1.7x on the route". This finishes D1. D1
# canonicalised the delivery-timing *aggregate* out of the digest and said in as
# many words that "delivery timing is gated as a bounded quantity instead of an
# equality" - but the bound was never implemented, so the per-delivery records
# still gated the guest's exact pc at delivery, which is a host turn-boundary
# quantity. Any change to how long a host turn is moved that field, so the gate
# rejected performance work by construction while every guest-state record in
# the route stayed identical.
#
# D2 gates the schedule as a bound instead of an equality. Removed from the
# digest: the per-delivery `cycle`, `prefix` and `pc`, and the route clock's
# `cycles` and `ai_remainder`. Still gated, exactly: the record and delivery
# counts, the delivery ordinals, causes and contexts, every other record in the
# set, the normal-stop pc, and the card. The removed quantities are compared as
# bounds on every multi-run comparison below, so a change that actually moves
# the schedule past the bound still fails.
#
# The bounds are the measured spread, not a guess. Across the four idle-skip
# settings that engage the donor's skip (batch 16, 32, 128, 256) against the
# shipping batch of 8, on the full 14,100-retrace route: same 1,050 records,
# same 1,024 deliveries, 899 of 1,024 delivery cycles bit-identical, the largest
# delivery move exactly one cycle, and the route clock -2 cycles out of
# 114,210,000,002. All four settings produced the same values as each other.
