# BlueWake shipping-configuration benchmark.
#
# Runs the exact headless cap-256 Outset route documented in
# local-research/evidence/outset-performance-route-v1-20260901 and reports the
# five governing numbers:
#
#   1. median fps over the live-Outset window
#   2. p99 frame time (ms) over the same window
#   3. wall seconds versus guest seconds (real-speed ratio)
#   4. peak RSS (bytes)
#   5. route digest (scripts/route_digest.py), compared to the accepted baseline
#
# The digest is what makes a speedup admissible: a run that buys fps by
# changing guest behaviour fails the comparison and is not a result. Under D2
# the comparison gates guest state by equality and the host's turn schedule by
# a bound, so `scripts/route_digest.py` also has to be happy, not just this
# digest line - it prints the observed delivery and clock drift it allowed.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/bench.sh                    # full 14,100-retrace Outset route
#   scripts/bench.sh --retraces 700     # bounded sanity tier
#   scripts/bench.sh --out DIR          # explicit artifact directory
#
# Environment overrides:
#   BLUEWAKE_BENCH_HOST       host binary (default build/runtime-host-dsp/bluewake_host)
#   BLUEWAKE_BENCH_COMPOSITE  composite dylib
#   BLUEWAKE_BENCH_CARD       copied save card used as the route input
#   BLUEWAKE_BENCH_WINDOW     live-play window as START:END (default 13910:14100)

# regenerated build (docs/status/CURRENT.md, "the cycle window is a free
# lever"): same host, composite and card, play-window median 33.55 fps against
# 33.07 at 4096 and 31.38 under the previous dynamic 256-in-1024 policy, route
# wall 70.68 s against 73.76 s and 87.56 s, host turns 32,203,791 against
# 57,369,093 and 148,527,447, route digest UNCHANGED at every cap tested. At
# 16384 the cap stops mattering: the device deadlines bound the window, so this
# is "no cap" rather than a tuned value. BLUEWAKE_BENCH_CYCLE_CAP=dynamic
# restores the old policy and is what a regression compares against.

# Re-derived once under decision D1 (docs/GOAL_PROMPT_V16_2026-09-14.md): the
# route selector no longer gates on the delivery-timing aggregate, because that
# aggregate is the interrupt-acceptance schedule the cap owns. Both caps produce
# this digest on the completed pair; every guest-state record is unchanged and
# is still gated. The previous value was
# 2b7a1fa575b62a2eece2f1ed860542953a33689b4ca922b1a62cc644deab4e2b, which no
# longer compares like with like.
#
# Re-derived again under decision D2 (docs/status/CURRENT.md, 2026-09-17, "the
# DSP slice has Dolphin's idle skip switched off", and the D2 row in
# docs/status/DECISIONS.md): the selector now also canonicalises the host
# turn-boundary fields out of the per-delivery records and the route clock, and
# `scripts/route_digest.py` gates those as bounds. D1's previous value was
# 0d4cee87923dea4bc09ef89af34ed438c1d9542368058423c722c3ad50bf7b7a, which was
# reachable only with the DSP idle skip switched off. The DSP idle skip is now
# the shipping default (BLUEWAKE_DSP_BATCH=128), so this value is the one the
# shipping configuration produces; export BLUEWAKE_DSP_BATCH=8 and the same
# digest still comes back, with a one-cycle delivery drift and two cycles of
# route clock the selector now allows and reports.
