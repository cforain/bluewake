# External Dependencies & Research Repositories

All third-party repositories live in `ref/` (gitignored). Pinned SHAs recorded
at examination time. "Required" means required by the currently favored
architecture; "informative" means examined for research only.

Examined: 2026-08-09.

| KaiserGranatapfel/GameCubeRecompiled | https://github.com/KaiserGranatapfel/GameCubeRecompiled | (cloned, cursory look) | — | see repo | Experimental GC→Rust recompiler inspired by N64Recomp. Early toy. | INFORMATIVE |

Notes:
- No Nintendo game data has been downloaded or committed. The tww/tp decomps
  contain reconstructed source only and require a user-supplied original disc
  image to build/verify.
