// Mouse camera (the Mac host): click the game window to hand it the mouse,
// then moving it turns the camera around Link, left and right and up and
// down, and left click is A; Esc, or leaving the window, gives the mouse back. The mouse turns the
// game's own camera (its view angles), so walls, the stick's direction and the
// camera's easing behind Link all carry on as they do.
//
// In first person (C-stick up) and when aiming an item (bow, hookshot,
// boomerang, grappling hook, telescope, Picto Box) the mouse aims instead:
// it turns Link's own aim, one to one and within the game's limits, and the
// view follows it with no lag; the stick still aims as well.
//
// The wheel zooms: in third person it brings the follow camera in or out
// (0.5x to 2x its distance, kept until changed); in the telescope and the
// Picto Box it is their own 1x-9x zoom, a step a notch.
