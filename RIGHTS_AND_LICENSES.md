# Rights and licenses

## BlueWake's code

BlueWake is licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 3 or (at your option) any later
version. The full text is in [LICENSE](LICENSE).

GPLv3 is the license the parts BlueWake is built from allow together:

- the compatibility runtime, [RecompCore](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/RecompCore), is derived from
  [Dolphin](https://dolphin-emu.org/) (GPLv2 or later), and RecompCore's `COPYING` states that the fork
  as a whole is compatible with GPLv3
- the touch control overlay is adapted from SunPad (GPL-3.0)
- the translator, [DolRecomp](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/DolRecomp), and the Aurora renderer
  vendored in RecompCore keep their own licenses, recorded in those repositories

BlueWake is released as source only. Every app is built by its player, on their own Mac, from their own
disc ([docs/BUILD_YOUR_OWN.md](docs/BUILD_YOUR_OWN.md)).

## Game content

BlueWake is an independent, unofficial project, not affiliated with or endorsed by Nintendo. *The
Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker*, its code, data, characters, names and imagery, and the GameCube
trademark remain the property of their owners. BlueWake cannot grant rights it does not hold.

This repository contains no disc image, game assets, saves or code translated from the game. You
supply your own legally obtained USA `GZLE01` revision 0 disc, and the app or IPA you build from it
contains code translated from that disc (`Frameworks/gGZLE01_recomp.dylib`). That build is for your
own use: do not share, upload or sell it. The software license does not grant any rights in
game-derived code, and running a GPL-covered translator does not by itself place its output under
the GPL.

## Mods

Better Wind Waker, the widescreen code from Dolphin's game settings and HD texture packs are the work
of their authors and keep their own terms. The repository carries only the widescreen code's text
(`mods/widescreen/GZLE01.gecko`); the build fetches Better Wind Waker at a pinned commit and applies it
to your disc on your Mac, and you add texture packs yourself.
