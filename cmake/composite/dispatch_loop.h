/* The boundary loop, in the header and always inlined.
 *
 * Why it is not only the out-of-line function below. The composite dispatches
 * one guest block per iteration of this loop, and the dispatch arrives as a
 * function pointer, so passing it through the entry point of another
 * translation unit left the compiler with an indirect call it could not see
 * through: the pointer was reloaded from its stack slot at every guest edge and
 * neither selected_dispatch nor the chunk lookup beneath it could be inlined
 * into the loop. Called with a static function from the same translation unit
 * the call devirtualises, the lookup folds into the loop, and the loop's own
 * state survives an edge in registers instead of being rebuilt.
 *
 * The exported form and the unit test keep the out-of-line entry point; it is
 * this body, so the two cannot drift.
